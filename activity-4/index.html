                    "I had high hopes for these earbuds, but unfortunately, they didn't meet my expectations. While the sound quality is decent, I found the fit to be uncomfortable, especially during long listening sessions. Additionally, the battery life leaves much to be desired, as I often find myself having to recharge them multiple times throughout the day. Overall, I expected more from Apple."
